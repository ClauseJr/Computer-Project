## Key Questions
1. **Top Selling Price Categories**  
   What are the top 10 most expensive models and their full specifications?
   
2. **Compare Device Categories by Price & Features**  
   Contrast laptops and desktops in terms of price and release-year trends to reveal category-level differences.

3. **Measure Feature Impact on Price Variation**  
   Quantify how CPU tier, GPU tier, RAM, and storage drive price differences and determine which components are the strongest price predictors.

4. **Track Price Trends Across Release Years**  
   Analyze year-over-year pricing shifts from 2018–2025 to detect market inflation, deflation, or major pricing disruptions.

5. **Analyze Form Factor Pricing Differences**  
   Compare ultrabooks, towers, gaming laptops, and Mainstream to identify which form factors offer the best value relative to performance.

6. **Identifies price–performance relationships**  
   How do average prices vary across CPU performance tiers, and which tier offers the highest value relative to its specifications?
   
7. **Evaluates brand innovation trends**  
   Which brands have introduced the most new models in the past five years, and how do their average prices compare over the same period?

8. **Compares GPU tiering across device_type**  
   What is the distribution of GPU tiers across different device types, and which device category tends to use higher-end GPUs?

9. **Combined performance metrices**  
   Which form factors (e.g., ultrabook, gaming laptop, desktop tower) deliver the best performance-to-weight ratio based on CPU tier, GPU tier, and weight?

10. **Display Specification**  
   How do display specifications (panel type, resolution, refresh rate) influence average device pricing across the dataset?

11. **Explores price trends across hardware**  
    Which CPU and GPU combinations appear most frequently, and how does their average price compare to the dataset’s overall average?
